Here I provide details about a personal experience reconnecting with God after over one decade as a lost soul.

I recently flew by plane from Melbourne to Singapore.

I went to the prayer room in Melbourne at least 4 times prior to the flight.

On the flight, I spoke with the person sitting next to me.

I introduced myself as Jack, and he introduced himself as Ari.

I asked him if he wanted to talk during the flight. He responded that he did not have a problem.

Later I admitted that I had a problem, and I shared my problem with him.

He said that nothing he could say or do could help me, then made some small talk about his destination.

At some point, I told him he had a Godly face. He laughed, and thanked me.

Then for some reason I could not explain, I recognized him as God. And I said "You are God."

He didn't say anything. We sat in silence for a while. I could not think of
anything to say or ask.

Then he broke the silence and said "I will tell you one thing: You will overcome all obstacles".

This statement holds true, no matter who you are, one way or another.

I hope it reassures you as it has reassured me.
