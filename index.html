<p>Reassurance From God</p>

        <p>Here I provide details about a personal experience reconnecting with God after over one decade as a lost soul.</p>
<p>I recently flew by plane from Melbourne to Singapore.</p>
<p>I went to the prayer room in Melbourne at least 4 times prior to the flight.</p>
<p>On the flight, I spoke with the person sitting next to me.</p>
<p>I introduced myself as Jack, and he introduced himself as Ari.</p>
<p>I asked him if he wanted to talk during the flight. He responded that he did not have a problem.</p>
<p>Later I admitted that I had a problem, and I shared my problem with him.</p>
<p>He said that nothing he could say or do could help me, then made some small talk about his destination.</p>
<p>At some point, I told him he had a Godly face. He laughed, and thanked me.</p>
<p>Then for some reason I could not explain, I recognized him as God. And I said "You are God."</p>
<p>He didn't say anything. We sat in silence for a while. I could not think of
anything to say or ask.</p>
<p>Then he broke the silence and said "I will tell you one thing: You will overcome all obstacles".</p>
<p>This statement holds true, no matter who you are, one way or another.</p>
<p>I hope it reassures you as it has reassured me.</p>
